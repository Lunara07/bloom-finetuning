Reserved places: Of the total number of places offered in the general call for admissions to master's degree programmes, the following percentages, rounded up to the nearest whole number, shall be reserved: Five per cent of the total number of places for individuals with an accredited disability level equal to or above 33 per cent, as well as for students with permanent educational support needs linked to personal disability circumstances who have required specific resources and support during their previous studies in order to ensure they enjoyed full educational inclusion, Three per cent of the total number of places for high-level and high-performance atheletes. This percentage shall be increased to five per cent on master's programmes linked to sport sciences. Candidates who meet the requirements to apply for admission to more than one category of reserved places may do so. In the event that any reserved places are not taken up, they may be offered as general places. These shall be allocated following the order set out on the waiting list for general places rigurously, and students will have to enrol within the period established by the CEP."}, {"question": "Who can apply for part-time student status?", "answer": "In accordance with article 7 of the UIB Academic Regulations, this is the status that may be requested by students who, for various duly justified reasons, are unable to comply with regulations regarding the minimum number of enrolled credits and academic progress regulations. In this way, the minimum number of credits that students must enrol for is reduced, as well as the number of credits they are required to pass to continue on the programme. First-year full-time students must enrol for at least 30 credits, whereas first-year part-time students are required to enrol for at least 15 credits. Some of the reasons to be granted part-time student status must be accredited on a yearly basis for said status to be renewed, whereas others grant permanent part-time status. In order to apply for part-time student status, students must be in one of the following situations: Working with a minimum dedication of at least half of the maximum duration of the regular working day, Being affected by a physical, sensory or mental disability, to a degree of 33 per cent or above. The disability degree must be accredited by means of a certificate issued by the competent body for it to be validated, Being 45 years of age or above at the start of the academic year, Having family protection status or having to care for dependents, Being a high-level or high-performance athlete, Being enrolled full time during the current academic year on any speciality of the Advanced Diploma in Music, offered by the Advanced Conservatory of Music, Being in any other extraordinary situation that the competent body deems to be decisive in order to be granted part-time student status."}, {"question": "When do you have to apply for part-time student status?", "answer": "Students who wish to take a master's programme part-time, and who fulfil the requirements to do so, must apply for this status at the time of pre-registration, over the same online platform. In the event of a sudden change during the first semester, students may apply for part-time student status outside the set deadline. If they apply before the start of the extended enrolment period, they may reduce the number of credits to the minimum set out in articles 5.8 and 5.9 of the UIB Academic Regulations. In turn, students may only make changes to the number of second-semester credits for which they have enrolled, and in compliance with the academic requirements for subjects in the second semester."}, {"question": "What is the order of precedence?", "answer": "In order to allocate places, applications for admission to a master's degree programme, pathway/specialisation, method and site/centre shall be ranked in order of precedence. If there are n places, places shall be allotted to the first n applicants, and the remainder shall be placed on a waiting list in the same order of precedence. Graduates shall be given priority over students who still need to pass their final degree project and, at most, nine ECTS credits. Selection of the latter will be prioritised as per the following criteria: Specific criteria linked to the entry profile as defined in the degree verification report for each master's programme, Students who only have the foreign language level accreditation pending in order to be awarded the degree, Students whose only pending subject is the final degree project. In the event of a tie, the average mark obtained in the remaining subjects on the programme will be taken into account, Students who have pending credits from other subjects aside from the final degree project. In such instances, priority shall be given to students with fewer pending credits. In the event of a tie, the average mark obtained for all passed credits shall be taken into account. In order to establish the order of precedence for reserved places, these shall be ranked in the corresponding position within each group, depending on the entry requirement fulfilled by the student. Where students qualify for more than one category of reserved places, the following order of precedence will be used: Places reserved for individuals with an accredited disability level equal to or above 33 per cent, Places reserved for high-level/high-performance athletes, General places."}, {"question": "What are amendment lists?", "answer": "The Centre for Postgraduate Studies will review pre-registrations that were correctly formalised. If the pre-registration application contains any form or content error, the Centre for Postgraduate Studies will send an e-mail to students notifying them that they need to amend their pre-registration and stating the deadline for doing so. Moreover, where the master's pre-registration deadline has passed, the Centre for Postgraduate Studies will publish the list of students with amendments to be rectified and the final deadline to do so. Pre-registration applications with amendments still pending after the deadline has passed will not be considered."}, {"question": "How do admission lists work?", "answer": "After verifying the access criteria are fulfilled for the requested master's programme, the Centre for Postgraduate Studies will send the pre-registration application to the corresponding academic commission for said programme for an admission assessment and decision. The admission requirements and criteria for each master's programme are set out in the verification reports for each degree and may be viewed in the 'General Information' tab - 'Admission Criteria' section on the master's factsheet. The Centre for Postgraduate Studies will publish the provisional admissions list, final list and, where applicable, the waiting list, within the set deadlines for each call, in accordance with the resolution issued by the Academic Commission. Admitted students must formalise their enrolment within a set deadline via the Acad√®mic app. Failure to do so in the set timeframe will lead to candidates forfeiting their right to enrol or having to re-apply for a place on the master's programme for the same academic year (where they had already been admitted). The admission lists may include students who are on the waiting list. After the enrolment period has finalised, they will be offered any remaining places. Students on the waiting list who are finally admitted will be notified and have to formalise their enrolment within the set deadline. Failure to do so will lead to candidates forfeiting their right to enrol or having to re-apply for a place on the master's programme for the same academic year (where they had already been admitted). Admission lists may include non-admitted students. Those who are not admitted may lodge an appeal, where applicable, to the CEP management team, who will request whatever reports they deem appropriate to issue a decision."}, {"question": "Regulations governing access and admission to master's studies", "answer": "Royal Decree 822/2021 of 28th September that sets out the organisation of university programmes and quality assurance procedureDocument readings: https://www.boe.es/buscar/pdf/2021/BOE-A-2021-15781-consolidado.pdf, Regulatory Agreement 14423/2022 of 23rd March that governs access and admission to official master's programmes: https://seu.uib.cat/fou/acord/14423/, Resoluci√≥ del vicerector Gesti√≥ i Pol√≠tica de Postgrau i Formaci√≥ Permanent sobre els estudis de m√†ster que no permeten l'acc√©s amb matr√≠cula condicionada l'any acad√®mic 2022-23Document reading: https://cep.uib.eu/digitalAssets/678/678186_of_acces-matricula-condicionada_curs-2022_23_v2.pdf"}, {"question": "What grants are available for master's degrees?", "answer": "The Ministry of Education and Vocational Training offers general and mobility grants for university students every year. In addition, other institutions and organisations may occasionally offer grants and financial aid for postgraduate studies. The selection changes every year and, therefore, the UIB has set up a website for current information. You may also check the grants, awards and general financial aid section on the Centre for Postgraduate Studies website."}, {"question": "When is the pre-registration application considered to have been submitted?", "answer": "The pre-registration application is deemed to have been submitted appropriately when students click on 'Formalise application'. Once the application has been formalised, students will receive an e-mail with the application receipt, which, if necessary, will serve as proof that they have submitted an application to study a master's degree programme. Applications which have 'Started' status once the pre-registration deadline as expired shall not be assessed, and shall therefore be withdrawn."}, {"question": "Do I need to attach documentation if my prior studies were taken at the UIB?", "answer": "No, you do not need attach your degree certificate or any official transcript for UIB qualifications."}, {"question": "Do I need to attach documentation if my prior studies were taken at the UIB?", "answer": "No, you do not need attach your degree certificate or any official transcript for UIB qualifications."}, {"question": "What format should the documentation to attach to the application have?", "answer": "Documents that are uploaded to the pre-registration application must be legible and preferably in .pdf format, or be original documents with an electronic signature and a secure verification code."}, {"question": "Where do I have to upload the documents?", "answer": "Each document must be attached to the corresponding place in the application, and must contain all the pages in the correct order."}, {"question": "What validity do scanned documents have?", "answer": "Scanned documents attached to the pre-registration application are accepted provisionally for the application process. Documents with an electronic signature and secure verification code are equivalent to an original document."}, {"question": "When do the originals need to be submitted?", "answer": "In this instance, the originals must be submitted between 1st November and 31st March of the current year. Until original documents are submitted, the CEP is unable to issue any academic certificate for the master's programme, including the final degree certificate. The original and a photocopy must be submitted to the admin services in the Antoni Maria Alcover i Sureda building (Centre for Postgraduate Studies). You must request an appointment to do this step. Where documents are sent by post, a certified copy of each document must be included. The only stamps accepted are those issued by a registered Spanish notary public, a diplomatic service or the issuing body for the document, as long as payment for the certified stamp is accredited."}]
